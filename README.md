# game_of_lfife_py
This is my first python project. The project's goal is to recreate Conway's Game of Life.
You can read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) to find out more about the
game, which is in the class of [Cellular Autonoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton). 
You can visit [here](https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/) to play the game in your browser, or checkout
[Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWSR_7kZuYg) on YouTube to see both a better explanation and implamentation of the game.


At the moment the code is a small mess. I'm not really sure how to use pygame "correctly".
